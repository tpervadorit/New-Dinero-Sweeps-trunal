## 🛠️ Code Quality & Project Structure

To maintain high-quality, clean, and consistent code, we use Husky, ESLint, and Prettier.

## ✅ Code Quality Tools

- **Husky 🐶** - Prevents bad commits by running linting and formatting checks before code is pushed.
- **ESLint 📏** - Ensures consistent coding styles and catches errors in JavaScript/TypeScript.
- **Prettier 🎨** - Automatically formats code for readability and consistency.

## Setup Process:

- Before committing code, Husky runs ESLint and Prettier to enforce best practices.
- If any linting errors exist, the commit will be rejected until they are fixed.
- This ensures that all code in the repository remains clean, formatted, and bug-free.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
