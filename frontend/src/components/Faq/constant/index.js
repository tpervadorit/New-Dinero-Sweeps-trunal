          question: 'Conditions and Processes',
          answer: `Self-exclusion means to voluntarily stop participating in betting or gaming for a specified period of time, which can either be temporary or permanent. When you opt for self-exclusion, you accept the terms and conditions, and your exclusion will become effective immediately after you receive a confirmation email. The email will be sent to the email address linked to your account and will include the date when your self-exclusion period will end.
          
Note that self-exclusion requests made through the chat function will not be processed, but a customer support representative will assist you in emailing your request. Upon receiving your email request to close your account, a 24-hour "cooling-off" period will commence. After this period, the customer support agent will inform you of the self-exclusion options available, which include 1 week, 1 month, 6 months, and permanent self-exclusion. There will be no exceptions to these time periods, and you will need to respond to the email to confirm your choice. If you don't respond within 24 hours, your account will be reopened, and you will receive a confirmation email.

Once you have requested a self-exclusion, your account will remain closed for the specified time and cannot be reversed or shortened. If you have chosen a permanent self-exclusion, your account will remain closed indefinitely. The company will make reasonable efforts to enforce the self-exclusion policy, but it will not be held liable if you try to open a new account or succeed in doing so. Any wagers, rewards, or promotional entries made during the self-exclusion period will be forfeited and cannot be reinstated once the self-exclusion period is over.

It is your responsibility to abide by the self-exclusion agreement and not attempt to purchase or place any wagers on your excluded account or open any new accounts during the self-exclusion period. If you do violate the self-exclusion, the company may close any new accounts detected and retain the right to terminate any wagers you have placed. Any losses incurred during the self-exclusion period will not be refunded, and the company or its employees will not be held liable for any harm you may suffer.

Once the self-exclusion period is over, your account will automatically be reopened, and you will receive a confirmation email sent to your registered email address.`,
